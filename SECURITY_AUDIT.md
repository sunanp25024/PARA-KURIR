# Security Audit Report - INSAN Mobile

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Exposed API Credentials ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Supabase credentials exposed in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
- **Impact**: High - Could allow unauthorized access to database
- **Fix**: Replaced with placeholder values, added environment variable documentation

### 2. Insecure WebSocket Connection ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: DevStatus component using `ws://` instead of `wss://` in production
- **Impact**: Medium - WebSocket traffic could be intercepted
- **Fix**: Added protocol detection for secure WebSocket connections

### 3. Missing Content Security Policy ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Basic CSP headers, missing comprehensive policy
- **Impact**: Medium - Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive CSP with strict directives

### 4. React Context Authentication Error ⚠️ REQUIRES ATTENTION
- **Issue**: React hooks error in AuthContext causing app crashes
- **Impact**: High - Prevents user authentication
- **Status**: Monitoring - May require React version alignment

### 5. NPM Package Vulnerabilities ✅ MITIGATED
- **Issue**: Multiple moderate severity vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Details**: 
  - @babel/helpers: RegExp complexity vulnerability ✅ FIXED
  - brace-expansion: Regular Expression DoS vulnerability ✅ FIXED
  - esbuild: Development server SSRF vulnerability ⚠️ DEV-ONLY
- **Impact**: Medium to High - Could allow DoS attacks or SSRF in development
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Updated all fixable packages to secure versions
  - Remaining esbuild vulnerability only affects development server
  - Production builds use static files, not vulnerable to SSRF
  - Added .npmrc security configuration
  - Implemented automated security monitoring

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### Headers & Policies
- Enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict Transport Security (HSTS) with preload
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Input Validation
- XSS protection through script tag removal
- Request body sanitization
- Type validation on all endpoints

### Rate Limiting
- Authentication endpoint: 5 requests per 15 minutes
- API endpoints: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- File upload: 10 requests per hour

## Remaining Security Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Database Security**
   - Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies are active
   - Test role-based access controls

2. **File Upload Security**
   - Implement file type validation
   - Add virus scanning for uploaded files
   - Limit file sizes and formats

3. **Dependency Management**
   - ✅ Regular security audits implemented
   - ✅ Automated vulnerability scanning
   - Schedule monthly dependency updates

### Medium Priority
1. **Authentication Hardening**
   - Implement session timeout
   - Add two-factor authentication option
   - Monitor failed login attempts

2. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all administrative actions
   - Track user access patterns
   - Monitor suspicious activities

### Low Priority
1. **Performance Security**
   - Implement request throttling
   - Add DDoS protection
   - Monitor resource usage

## Production Deployment Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [x] All environment variables configured securely
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [x] HTTPS enforced across all endpoints
- [x] Security headers properly configured
- [x] NPM vulnerabilities mitigated (dev-only vulnerabilities remain)
- [x] Security monitoring scripts implemented
- [ ] RLS policies tested and active
- [ ] File upload restrictions in place

### After Deployment
- [ ] Security scan performed
- [ ] Penetration testing completed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested
- [ ] Incident response plan documented

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual data access patterns
- File upload activities
- API endpoint usage
- WebSocket connection attempts

### Alert Thresholds
- More than 5 failed logins per user per hour
- Unusual geographic access patterns
- Large file uploads outside business hours
- Repeated API failures from same IP

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Preserve evidence and logs
3. Notify stakeholders immediately
4. Implement temporary security measures
5. Conduct thorough investigation
6. Document lessons learned

### Rollback Procedures
- Database: Use Supabase point-in-time recovery
- Application: Deploy previous stable version
- User accounts: Temporary access restrictions
- File storage: Restore from backup
